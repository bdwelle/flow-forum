_Flow_ is the mental state of being fully immersed in energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of an activity. We are happier, more productive and more our best selves in Flow.

> “Most enjoyable activities are not natural; they demand an effort that initially one is reluctant to make. But once the interaction starts to provide feedback to the person's skills, it usually begins to be intrinsically rewarding.” 
― Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, [Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow)

_Flow Forum_ inspires and challenges us to lead extraordinary lives by focusing on being active in the outdoors, challenging ourselves with physical goals, and learning to use Flow in all aspects of our lives.

This forum includes many aspects of a traditional [EO Forum](http://www.eonetwork.org/why-join/forum/), with the addition of a significant focus on physical challenges and outdoor activities such as hiking, running, swimming, surfing, cycling, climbing, diving and others. Flow Forum was founded by EO San Francisco member [Bowen Dwelle](http://bowendwelle.com) and meets on a quarterly basis.
