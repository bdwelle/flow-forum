The third meeting of Flow Forum was held in April 2015 at the Sea Ranch on the beautiful northern California coast. We rented a house near a quiet cove and dove for abalone on a perfect sunny spring day, and then held our forum meeting there over the course of the evening and the following morning. Perfect Flow Forum!
