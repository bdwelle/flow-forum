title: Inaugural Flow Forum meeting
---

We held our first Flow Forum meeting in the Santa Cruz mountains in September 2014. The first day consisted of a long fast hike beginning with an hour of silent walking. After our hike we drove out to the coast and had dinner at the lodge at Costanoa, and then went stand-up paddling the following morning in Santa Cruz harbor. A fantastic start to Flow Forum!
