## Flow Forum is opening our borders! 

Flow Forum is now open to members in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico (and perhaps beyond). In the past, the forum was limited to members based in or near San Francisco. Due to some members leaving EO, we are opening the forum to broader participation. Two of the founding members are committed to reboot Flow Forum and plan a new series of meetings in 2019. We have several people interested, and our goal is be to have our first meeting with the new group in January 2019. 

If you are interested in the possibility of joining Flow Forum, please contact [Bowen Dwelle](mailto:bdwelle+eo@gmail.com?subject=Flow Forum) &mdash; we'd love to hear from you!
