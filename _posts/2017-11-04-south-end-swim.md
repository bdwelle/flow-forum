In November 2017 we met at the historic [South End Rowing Club](http://serc.com) and had a beautiful (and fairly cold) swim out to the opening of Aquatic Park. As you can see from the photo, however, we did wear wetsuits, and were therefore relegated to the "Designated Sniveling Area", since most South Enders typically swim without rubber.
