In March 2017 we went down to Joshua Tree and did a day of climbing in this incredibly beautiful and unique world-class rock climbing area, and enjoyed the cool vibe at the Ace Hotel in Palm Springs. Rock climbing runs deep in my blood and is another truly awesome way to connect our bodies with the natural world and to get into Flow.
