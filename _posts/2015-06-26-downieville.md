title: Mountain Biking in Downieville
---

The fourth meeting of Flow Forum was held in June 2015. We met in Downieville and biked the world-famous Downieville Downhill, and then spent the weekend at a beautiful house just outside Nevada City, CA. Downhill mountain biking is an idea flow activity, and the California foothills are stunning this time of year, with plenty of swimming holes to cool off from the summer heat.
