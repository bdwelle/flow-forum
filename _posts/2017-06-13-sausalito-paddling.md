In June 2017 we met in Sausalito and spent the entire morning on the water, stand up paddling in Richardson Bay. 
We had perfect weather and paddled out to Yellow Bluff and then over to Belevedere before returning for lunch and a 
full afternoon of forum presentations. Another top-notch and very unique Flow Forum experience!
